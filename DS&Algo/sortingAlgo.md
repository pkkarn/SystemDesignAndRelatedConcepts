# Sorting Algorithms


## Insertion

- Insertion Sort: O(n) best case, O(n^2) worst case
-- Okay for small mostly sorted lists

## Merge Sort

- Time Complexity is: O(nlog(n))[better than O(n^2) but not better than O(n)]
- scales well to large lists

## Quick Sort

- Time Complexity is O(nlogn) but in worst case it can be like O(n^2)

## Bubble Sort:

- Time Complexity is: O(n^2)
