Lets try to understand this with an example of HDFS Architecture...

# HDFS

HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It's a key component of Apache Hadoop, an open-source framework designed for processing and storing large amounts of data across clusters of computers.

Here are some key characteristics and functionalities of HDFS:

1. **Distributed Storage**: HDFS is designed to be deployed across multiple machines, known as nodes, in a cluster. This design allows the system to store extremely large amounts of data, far beyond what could be stored on a single machine.

2. **Fault Tolerance**: HDFS automatically replicates data across different nodes. This replication improves data reliability. If one node fails, the data is still available from another node.

3. **High Throughput**: HDFS is designed to provide high data transfer rates between nodes. This feature makes it particularly suitable for applications that need to process large amounts of data, like many big data analytics applications.

4. **Scalability**: HDFS can easily scale out by adding more nodes to the cluster. This scalability allows the system to grow as the amount of data grows.

5. **Data Locality**: HDFS tries to keep data as close as possible to the computation to reduce the amount of network traffic. This feature improves the performance of data processing tasks.

6. **Large Block Sizes**: HDFS uses larger block sizes (e.g., 64MB or 128MB) compared to traditional file systems. This feature reduces the amount of metadata stored and allows for efficient, sequential I/O operations, which are ideal for processing large files.

HDFS is a foundational element of many big data technologies and is often used in conjunction with Apache Hadoop's other components, like MapReduce, for distributed data processing.

## HDFS Architecture:

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a Java-based distributed, scalable, and portable file system designed by Apache Foundation. It's an essential part of Apache Hadoop and is designed to handle large data sets in a distributed computing environment. HDFS is based on Google's File System (GFS) and applies the principle of data locality where computation related to the data happens near the location of data to reduce network congestion. 

Here are some key components and concepts in HDFS architecture:

1. **NameNode**: This is the master node that manages the file system metadata. It maintains and manages the blocks which are present on the DataNodes. In simple terms, it knows how to construct the file from the blocks and which blocks are on which DataNodes. It does not store actual data or dataset. 

2. **DataNode**: These are the slave nodes in HDFS. Each DataNode serves up blocks of data over the network, using a block protocol specific to HDFS. The DataNodes also perform block creation, deletion, and replication upon instruction from the NameNode.

3. **Block**: In HDFS, the data is divided into blocks, and these blocks are distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster. Each block is typically of size 128MB by default, but this can be increased based on the requirement. Each block is independently replicated at multiple DataNodes to ensure reliability.

4. **Secondary NameNode**: This is a specially dedicated node that periodically merges the namespace image with the edit log to prevent the edit log from becoming too large. It is not a backup for the NameNode.

The typical operation when you save a file in HDFS is as follows:

1. The client contacts the NameNode and asks to create a file.
2. The NameNode creates the file (minus the data) in its namespace and returns success to the client.
3. The client then writes data. This data is broken into chunks (HDFS blocks), which the client writes to the DataNodes. The replication factor determines how many copies of each block to make and where to store them.
4. Once the client has written the data, it tells the NameNode that the file is closed.
5. The NameNode commits the file creation operation into a persistent store. If the NameNode dies before the file is closed, the file is lost.

Key benefits of HDFS include its fault tolerance (if a node goes down, data processing can still occur by switching to another path), high throughput (efficient data processing), and scalability (it can scale up by simply adding more nodes to the system).

However, HDFS is not suitable for low-latency data access, lots of small files, or arbitrary file modifications. For such tasks, other file systems or databases may be more suitable.
