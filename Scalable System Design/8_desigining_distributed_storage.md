Lets try to understand this with an example of HDFS Architecture...

# HDFS

HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It's a key component of Apache Hadoop, an open-source framework designed for processing and storing large amounts of data across clusters of computers.

Here are some key characteristics and functionalities of HDFS:

1. **Distributed Storage**: HDFS is designed to be deployed across multiple machines, known as nodes, in a cluster. This design allows the system to store extremely large amounts of data, far beyond what could be stored on a single machine.

2. **Fault Tolerance**: HDFS automatically replicates data across different nodes. This replication improves data reliability. If one node fails, the data is still available from another node.

3. **High Throughput**: HDFS is designed to provide high data transfer rates between nodes. This feature makes it particularly suitable for applications that need to process large amounts of data, like many big data analytics applications.

4. **Scalability**: HDFS can easily scale out by adding more nodes to the cluster. This scalability allows the system to grow as the amount of data grows.

5. **Data Locality**: HDFS tries to keep data as close as possible to the computation to reduce the amount of network traffic. This feature improves the performance of data processing tasks.

6. **Large Block Sizes**: HDFS uses larger block sizes (e.g., 64MB or 128MB) compared to traditional file systems. This feature reduces the amount of metadata stored and allows for efficient, sequential I/O operations, which are ideal for processing large files.

HDFS is a foundational element of many big data technologies and is often used in conjunction with Apache Hadoop's other components, like MapReduce, for distributed data processing.

## HDFS Architecture:

- Files are broken up into blocks, replicated across your clusters
